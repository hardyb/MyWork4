abc.def




gradient
ab.de

trie_lookup_longest_prefix_extra2 matches that data message to that gradient


so...
eg with incoming advert

this is to set up obtain gradients back to the source

incoming may be: ab.cd

we have already confirmed that cd is within (/one of) the setup contexts
we have already set an obtain gradient for this state node
( what does this mean in our new situation?                  
A: 
- add (or find if already there) this specific fully qualiified state to the trie
- get a pointer to the trie node added/found
- get the state object at that node
- use the state object, incoming interface and path value to add/update the corresponding gradient
 )


now we want to find the matching state node
( what does this mean in our new situation?                   
A:




)

then check the
