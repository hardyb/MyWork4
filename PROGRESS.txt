ROLES
============
I think I added the new role stuff in, changing it slowly bit by bit
to the raw byte array including transaction array as distinct from the 
linked list version.

Not sure if I finished the bit where roles can be added to a 
node directly from the vs app'

I 'think' I redid the bit that runs the default role that just does forwarding
I 'think' I tested this.






THE NEW TRIES for the new data name and context system
=======================================================

So far I 'think' I have just added the structs and the 
functions in for this, but haven't hooked them up in
any way.


No, doesn't look like it
