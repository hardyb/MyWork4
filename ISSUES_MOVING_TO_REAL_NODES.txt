

we need a frame format:



bytes

1	The messag type, ie neighbor data, advert, etc
1	For the moment this will be just one byte, indicating the relevant value




preconfigured adverts are sent when the device knows it has a neighbor
this is fine as adverts still discipate as more devices come on line

Various packets are sent out in response to incoming packets
we need a mechanism to direct to the relevant function


We need to decide how to know to send out reinforcements
OK - so for now lets do this as above, ie in response to incoming packet (ie advert)
BUT.....
What about while advertisments are still being set up
We will be reinforcing a path that is not yet the best 
over a network that is still establishing the routes
DO WE NEED TO WAIT?
What do we wait for?  We could wait till all gradients have a value
but even then sme values could be updated with better values as the
network establishes itself



We need to decide how to know to send out data out

May be just in response to certain degrees of changes on sensors
provided of course there is a reinforced interface

===========================================================================



we need to make the interfaces generic

perhaps we need call backs for actions like forwarding etc

may be call backs for send to interface including send to (self) application
