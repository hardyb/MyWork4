Now compiling
a lot of unused stuff in the framework and in the old cpp code has been commented out ok
need to update the bit that reads in the sink and source data values and
sets these in the framework
also need to consider the work to set a time for reinforcement required
and action the reinforcement after a brief wait to know that all gradient costs are in







VERSION 2.1.1

From here on We shalll call version 2 the one with the hierarchical naming

This current version is not yet compiled or tested

comilation appears to have left the introduction of some additional 
members to the state object I think
